## How to clone a remote repo to local

To clone a GitHub repository to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Copy the repository's URL. For your repo, you can use:
```bash
https://github.com/aloopday/html5-note.git
```

2. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).

3. Run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aloopday/html5-note.git
```

4. This will create a folder named html5-note in your current directory with all the repository's files.

If you use SSH, you can use:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:aloopday/html5-note.git
```

Let me know if you need help with SSH setup or further steps!

## What is SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD operations) within a database, as well as define its structure and control access. SQL is widely used in database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.

Key functions include:
- **Querying data**: Retrieving specific data using `SELECT` statements.
- **Inserting data**: Adding records with `INSERT`.
- **Updating data**: Modifying records with `UPDATE`.
- **Deleting data**: Removing records with `DELETE`.
- **Schema management**: Creating or altering tables with `CREATE` and `ALTER`.

SQL is declarative, meaning you specify what data you want, and the database engine determines how to retrieve it. It’s essential for data analysis, reporting, and backend development.
