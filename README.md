## How to clone a remote repo to local

To clone a GitHub repository to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Copy the repository's URL. For your repo, you can use:
```bash
https://github.com/aloopday/html5-note.git
```

2. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).

3. Run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aloopday/html5-note.git
```

4. This will create a folder named html5-note in your current directory with all the repository's files.

If you use SSH, you can use:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:aloopday/html5-note.git
```

Let me know if you need help with SSH setup or further steps!

## What is SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD operations) within a database, as well as define its structure and control access. SQL is widely used in database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.

Key functions include:
- **Querying data**: Retrieving specific data using `SELECT` statements.
- **Inserting data**: Adding records with `INSERT`.
- **Updating data**: Modifying records with `UPDATE`.
- **Deleting data**: Removing records with `DELETE`.
- **Schema management**: Creating or altering tables with `CREATE` and `ALTER`.

SQL is declarative, meaning you specify what data you want, and the database engine determines how to retrieve it. It’s essential for data analysis, reporting, and backend development.

##  What is SVG

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based format for defining two-dimensional vector graphics. Unlike raster images (e.g., PNG, JPEG), SVG images are resolution-independent, meaning they can scale infinitely without losing quality, making them ideal for logos, icons, and illustrations on websites or applications.

Key features:
- **Vector-based**: Uses mathematical shapes (paths, lines, curves) instead of pixels, ensuring crisp visuals at any size.
- **Text-based**: Defined in XML, so it’s human-readable and editable with code.
- **Interactivity**: Supports animations and interactivity via CSS or JavaScript.
- **Small file size**: Efficient for simple graphics compared to high-resolution raster images.
- **Web compatibility**: Natively supported in modern browsers.

Example SVG code for a circle:
```xml
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="blue" />
</svg>
```

SVG is widely used in web design, data visualization, and responsive interfaces.

## What is `<ruby>`

The `<ruby>` element in HTML is used to represent ruby annotations, which are small annotations or pronunciations typically placed above or beside characters, commonly used in East Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean to provide phonetic or semantic guidance. It’s particularly useful for displaying furigana (Japanese phonetic readings) or pinyin (Chinese pronunciation).

### Structure
The `<ruby>` tag wraps the base text and its annotation, often using:
- `<rt>`: Specifies the ruby text (annotation) displayed above or beside the base text.
- `<rp>`: Optional fallback for browsers that don’t support ruby, typically containing parentheses or other markers.

### Example
```html
<ruby>
  漢字 <rt>かんじ</rt>
  <rp>(kanji)</rp>
</ruby>
```
- **Output**: Displays "漢字" with "かんじ" (kanji) as a small annotation above it. In browsers without ruby support, it might show as "漢字 (kanji)".

### Key Points
- **Purpose**: Enhances readability of ideographic scripts by providing pronunciation or meaning.
- **Browser Support**: Widely supported in modern browsers, with `<rp>` ensuring graceful degradation.
- **Use Case**: Common in educational content, language learning tools, and East Asian typography.
